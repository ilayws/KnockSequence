# KnockSequence
Recognize a door-knock sequence with Processing.

Clicking = Knocking
When the program starts it records your first sequence (blue flash when finished recording).
Then you can attempt the password (red flash = incorrect sequence, green flash = correct sequence)

To record a new sequence press SPACE shortly and then input your new sequence.

This can be used to create a door that unlocks automatically for a certain knocking sequence (for example with arduino, vibration sensor and motor unlock the door).
